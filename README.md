# AirBnb Analysis

This is the first project I completed while earning my Data Analysis certificate at TripleTen.

The data is taken from AirBnB and is an analysis of the top ten neighborhoods with the most reviews, 
as seen by the bar chart below, neighborhoods and the number of bedrooms their listings have, and 
which listings are the most profitable.
